Natas Level 1 → Level 2 Walkthrough

Goal: Find the password for natas2

Walkthrough:

- The challenge page prevents right-click via JavaScript, which blocks the usual "View Page Source" option.
- Bypass the restriction by opening Developer Tools (press `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `F12`).
- With DevTools open you can inspect the HTML normally.
- In the page source there is an HTML comment that contains the password for `natas2`.
- Copy that password and use it to log in to `natas2`.

Screenshots:

- `images/intro.jpg`: Natas introduction screenshot (the page with right-click blocked).
- `images/answer.jpg`: Final screenshot showing the password (the answer image).

Notes:

- The password is intentionally hidden inside an HTML comment; viewing the DOM with DevTools reveals it.
- I will include the two screenshots alongside this README: the intro screenshot and the final answer photo.
