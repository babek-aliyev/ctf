# 🏴‍☠️ CTF Writeups & Notes
This repository contains my personal CTF writeups and solution notes from various platforms (picoCTF, TryHackMe, Hack The Box, etc.).

The goal of this repo is learning, not spoiling challenges.

**👉 Flags are intentionally NOT included**

Each writeup explains the **approach, reasoning, and techniques**, so readers are encouraged to reproduce the steps and find the flag on their own.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Challenges are grouped by platform

Then optionally by category or difficulty

Each folder contains:

1) Challenge description (short)

2) Analysis & thought process

3) Exploit / solution steps

4) Code snippets (when relevant)

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here
Step-by-step **problem-solving mindset**

Common **CTF techniques & patterns**

Notes on:

1) Web exploitation

2) Reverse engineering

3) Cryptography

4) Binary exploitation

5) Linux & networking basics

This ***is not a copy-paste exploit repo***, but a place to understand why things work.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1) Try the challenge yourself first

2) Get stuck? Read the writeup partially

3) Apply the technique

4) Find the flag on your own 🏁

That’s how real learning happens.
